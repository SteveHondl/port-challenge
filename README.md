# port-challenge


## Description

As an aspiring web developer, this project has given me a small taste of front end development.  I am not very happy with the end result of this project but I am excited to improve and add more skills and abilities moving forward.  I struggled with a lot of the concepts and my CSS contains a lot of dry and inefficient code.  This is a project that I would enjoy attempting again and I have already started wire-framing for a potential do-over.
